It’s good to see u again.
Today I wake up at 06 A.M in the morning.
After that I started to study my java lectures till 07 A.M.
After that I had just walking here and there on the terrace.
Then I went to take my breakfast and then I went to take shower and quickly ready for the office.
Although this job not for my line but for the earning it’s not enough for me.
I left for the office at 07:50 A.M. 
Today I am the first to reach at the office or I can say “I am second after that girl”.
Today Weather is looking so good.
The wind is blowing very fast and it feels to me like a cold.
Then I started to start my pc and started my work in pending. 
Today that girl which used to be my friend at some time has been came late today and so I asked Neha (one of our colleague) to bring her phone.
When we go out there to bring our phones our another colleague has come. 
We take his friends and began to start the attendance. 
Thanks to u to listen me
